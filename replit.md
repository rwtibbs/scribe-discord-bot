# TabletopScribe Discord Bot

A Discord bot that allows authenticated TabletopScribe users to record voice channel audio directly in Discord, then automatically upload it to TabletopScribe for processing.

## Overview

This bot integrates with your existing TabletopScribe infrastructure (AWS Cognito, S3, AppSync GraphQL) to provide seamless voice recording capabilities from Discord. Features secure web-based authentication where users authenticate via a browser (instead of typing credentials in Discord) and can copy campaign-specific commands to clipboard.

## Features

- **Secure Web Authentication**: Users authenticate via browser using cryptographically secure, time-limited setup tokens
- **Persistent Sessions**: PostgreSQL database stores user credentials across bot restarts
- **Campaign Selection UI**: Web interface displays campaigns with clipboard copy for /record commands
- **Voice Recording**: Join Discord voice channels and record audio
- **Auto-Upload**: Convert recordings to MP3 and upload to S3
- **Session Creation**: Automatically create sessions in TabletopScribe via GraphQL using Cognito sub
- **Multi-Environment**: Support for DEV and DEVSORT environments

## Discord Commands

- `/setup` - Generate secure link for web-based authentication (15-minute expiry, single-use)
- `/campaigns` - List your campaigns (requires prior /setup authentication)
- `/record <campaign-name>` - Start recording in current voice channel (requires authentication)
- `/stop` - Stop recording and upload to TabletopScribe

## Discord Bot Setup

### Required OAuth2 Permissions

The bot must be invited to your Discord server with these permissions:
- **Connect** (1048576) - Join voice channels
- **Speak** (2097152) - Transmit audio (required for voice connection)
- **View Channels** - See channels
- **Send Messages** - Respond to commands

**Bot Invite URL Format:**
```
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=3146752&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your Discord bot's client ID from the environment variables.

**Permission Value: 3146752** (Connect + Speak + basic permissions)

⚠️ **Important**: If you're getting "operation was aborted" errors when trying to record, the bot likely needs to be re-invited with the correct permissions using the URL above.

## Environment Variables

Required secrets (configured in Replit Secrets):
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Discord bot token
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` - Discord application client ID
- `USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID_DEV` - AWS Cognito user pool client ID
- `APPSYNC_API_KEY` - AppSync API key
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS secret access key

**For Reserved VM Deployments:**
- `PUBLIC_URL` - **REQUIRED** for deployments. Set this to your deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-subdomain.replit.app`)
  - Without this, the `/setup` command will fail on deployed bots
  - Not needed in development (auto-detected)

Optional environment variables:
- `AWS_ENVIRONMENT` - Set to 'DEVSORT' for dev environment (defaults to 'DEV')
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region (defaults to 'us-east-2')

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Discord**: discord.js, @discordjs/voice
- **Audio**: opusscript, prism-media, ffmpeg
- **AWS**: amazon-cognito-identity-js, aws-sdk
- **Frontend**: React, Vite (status page)

## Workflow

### Initial Setup (One-Time Authentication)
1. User types `/setup` command in Discord
2. Bot generates cryptographically secure token (32 bytes, 15-minute expiry)
3. Bot stores token in database and sends private link to user
4. User clicks link and is directed to web-based login page
5. Login page validates token (not expired, not previously used)
6. User enters TabletopScribe credentials
7. Backend authenticates with AWS Cognito
8. Backend stores session in database: {discordUserId, accessToken, username, cognitoSub}
9. Token is marked as used (prevents reuse/account hijacking)
10. User redirected to campaigns page showing their campaigns
11. User clicks "Copy Command" button for desired campaign
12. User pastes `/record "Campaign Name"` command into Discord

### Recording Workflow
1. User joins a voice channel and pastes `/record "Campaign Name"` (from campaigns page)
2. Bot looks up stored credentials from database using Discord user ID
3. Bot joins channel and starts recording audio
4. User types `/stop` when finished
5. Bot:
   - Saves recording to temporary file
   - Converts PCM to MP3
   - Creates session in GraphQL using stored Cognito sub
   - Uploads audio to S3
   - Updates session with audio URL
   - Sends confirmation message
6. TabletopScribe's existing Lambda processing takes over

## Recording Process

1. Audio is captured from Discord voice channel in PCM format
2. PCM is converted to MP3 using ffmpeg
3. MP3 is uploaded to S3 bucket at `public/audioUploads/`
4. Session is created in GraphQL with status "UPLOADED"
5. Session appears in TabletopScribe web app for processing

## Session Management

### Authentication Sessions (PostgreSQL)
- User credentials stored persistently in `discord_sessions` table
- Each session contains: Discord user ID, Cognito access token, username, and Cognito sub
- Sessions survive bot restarts
- Used for all GraphQL API calls (campaigns, session creation)

### Setup Tokens (PostgreSQL)
- Stored in `setup_tokens` table with 15-minute expiration
- Cryptographically random (32 bytes from crypto.randomBytes)
- Single-use enforcement: marked as used after successful login
- Expired or used tokens rejected to prevent security vulnerabilities

### Recording Sessions (In-Memory)
- Active recording state tracked in memory via session-manager
- Includes audio stream, campaign info, and start time
- Cleared after `/stop` command completes upload

## Security Features

- **Cryptographic Tokens**: Setup tokens use Node.js crypto.randomBytes (32 bytes = 256 bits of entropy)
- **Time-Limited Access**: Setup tokens expire after 15 minutes
- **Single-Use Tokens**: Tokens marked as used after login, preventing reuse and account hijacking
- **No Credentials in Discord**: Users never type passwords in Discord chat
- **Cognito Sub Usage**: All GraphQL calls use Cognito sub (user ID) instead of username for proper authentication
- **Database Validation**: Every request validates session existence and token status

## Known Limitations

### Voice Recording on Replit
⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Voice recording does not work on standard Replit hosting.**

Discord voice connections require:
- **WebSocket (TCP)** - for signaling/control ✅ Works
- **UDP ports 50000-65535** - for voice data transmission ❌ Blocked by Replit

The bot will successfully join voice channels (you'll see it appear in the channel), but the voice connection times out after 20-30 seconds because UDP traffic is blocked. The connection gets stuck in "connecting" state and never reaches "ready".

**Connection State Observed:**
```
signalling → connecting → [stuck] → timeout → destroyed
```

### Solutions

1. **Deploy to Reserved VM** - Replit's Reserved VM Deployments may support UDP (not confirmed)
2. **Alternative Hosting** - Deploy to VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2) or specialized Discord bot hosting (Railway, Fly.io)
3. **Hybrid Approach** - Keep web UI on Replit, run bot on UDP-compatible hosting, share the same database

All non-voice features work perfectly on Replit:
- ✅ Authentication (`/setup`)
- ✅ Campaign listing (`/campaigns`)
- ✅ Database operations
- ✅ GraphQL API integration
- ❌ Voice recording (UDP required)

## Notes

- Bot must have permission to join voice channels
- Recordings are stored temporarily and deleted after upload
- Audio quality: 48kHz, 2 channels, MP3 192kbps
- Maximum recording duration: Limited by Discord/system resources
- Setup tokens automatically cleaned up when expired (consider scheduled cleanup task for production)
